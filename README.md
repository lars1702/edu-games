Edu-games is an ambitious attempt at creating a platform for educational games that allows you, as i.e. a teacher or a parent to 
- play educational games eith your children
- learn what difficulties the games can help with
- (in the future) read about helpful resources (like education.com) and important terms used across the site ('gamification', 'serious games', 'special needs', 'autism', 'dyscalculia', 'information processing', and more)


As it is, this project in its infancy. Or more accurately, it's more of a really, really small fetus. Still, I have several ambitions with this project, and most of those can be found on my Trello-board for the project.
